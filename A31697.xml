            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE CHARACTER OF <hi>A Modern Sham-Plotter.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>HE is the Common Enemy of Honeſt Mankind: ſo pregnant with Venom, that his very ſight (like a <hi>Baſilisk</hi>) kills. A <hi>Wretch</hi> ſo Peſtilent, that if (by <hi>Diabolical</hi> Inſinuation) he can faſten a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments privacy upon an <hi>Innocent</hi> man, he never leaves <hi>Swearing,</hi> till he has got him <hi>Hang'd, Drawn,</hi> and <hi>Quarter'd.</hi> A right Son of <hi>Belial;</hi> of the Progeny of <hi>Judas;</hi> Midwif'd by the <hi>Meal-Tub-Hag;</hi> Tutor'd by Old <hi>Nick,</hi> or by his Vicegerent, the <hi>Triple-Crown'd-Monſter;</hi> and taught Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticks by the Malignant Brats of <hi>Ignatiue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Beggarly <hi>Raſcal,</hi> that lives by the <hi>Price of Blood;</hi> the very <hi>Incendiary</hi> of Nations, and the <hi>Compendium</hi> or <hi>Epitome</hi> of all Villany.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Damming, Sinking, Whoring, Roaring, Drunkenneſs,</hi> &amp;c. are his private Recreations, and <hi>Devotion.</hi> His ſtudy is the deſtruction of Innocents, how to frame his damnable Projects (not in a Mathematical,) but in a <hi>Diabolical Symmetry.</hi> He Diſgorges <hi>Oaths</hi> with greater eaſe then he Spues out the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluity of his Intemperate Debauches.</p>
            <p>He cannot want <hi>Invention,</hi> for the <hi>Father of Lies</hi> ſets him his Copy; the <hi>Locuſts</hi> of the Bottom leſs <hi>Pit</hi> guide his hand; and the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> teach him to Con his Leſſon.</p>
            <p>His Forehead is ſo brazen'd with Impudence, that he Blaſphemes the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity</hi> in the Face of the Sun; makes the Law <hi>Pimp</hi> to his wide-mouth'd Perjuries: and Sacrifices Lives with leſs Compaſſion than <hi>Cannibals</hi> eat Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</p>
            <p>He is an active <hi>Species</hi> of Vermine, that works under Ground, laying his Mines cloſe, to blow up Lives and Eſtates; but if once detected, <hi>Proteus</hi> cannot ſhift himſelf into ſuch a variety of ſhapes as this <hi>Varlet</hi> (this <hi>Rogue</hi> in <hi>Grain</hi>) has Methods to Sham his Plots, upon ſuch whoſe Ruin he has be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore contriv'd.</p>
            <p>His <hi>Dexterity</hi> in Malice cannot be parallel'd, but by his Maſter the <hi>Devil,</hi> to whom there is nothing on Earth more like. The <hi>Sham-Plotters</hi> of old were <hi>Dunces</hi> to him: Silly Fools, dull at Contrivance, with one String to their Bow, and one Arrow in their Quiver, which (once miſſing the Mark) by the diſcovery of the Ambuſcade, or the unskilfulneſs of the Archer, the Stratagem expir'd without a Reſurrection; but this Modern Graduate in <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zebubs</hi> School, can either <hi>Sham</hi> off the Old, or <hi>Conceive, Form,</hi> and <hi>bring forth,</hi> a New Plot, in as little time as he can Belch out an Oath, [affronting
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:98958:2"/>that ineffable Majeſty, whoſe tremendous Name he never uſes but in that Dialect of horrible Volleys of <hi>God-dam-me's,</hi> yet expects to be believed as if he made Conſcience of Swearing in his more Solemn and (therefore more) Abominable <hi>Perjuries.</hi>]</p>
            <p>He Haunts the Apartments of <hi>Grandees</hi> and <hi>Magiſtrates,</hi> like an Evil Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. The leading men of the State he labours to ſeduce and frighten with Apparitions of horrid, <hi>Phanatick, Presbyterian</hi> Plots, (the <hi>Embrio's</hi> indeed, and Production of <hi>Jeſuitical Brains.</hi>) The Burden of his Song is <hi>Forty, One, Forty One;</hi> impudently affronting His Majeſty, who paſt an Act of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dempnity, Enacting that no man ſhould reproach another with his being concerned in that unhappy War, and Graciouſly Pardon'd the Delinquents, (except ſuch as were executed) yet Old <hi>Towzer</hi> the <hi>Obſervator</hi> (as Venemous an <hi>Aſp</hi> as ever ſpit Poyſon) <hi>Heraclitus,</hi> (that egregious <hi>Buffoon</hi>) <hi>N.

            <p>(Whilſt he tickles the Fancy of his <hi>Dam-ming</hi> Tribe by the Scurrillity of his Drunken Wit) forgets the Diſmal <hi>IRISH MASSACRE, G<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>N<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>POWDER TREASON,</hi> the preſent <hi>HORRID</hi> and <hi>Damnable Plot,</hi> &amp;c, Which are (beſides innumerable more <hi>Romiſh Treaſons</hi>) ſo notorious to <hi>KING, PARLIAMENT,</hi> and <hi>PEOPLE,</hi> that the <hi>Barking</hi> of theſe <hi>Curs,</hi> the <hi>Shams</hi> of theſe <hi>Villans,</hi> the <hi>Roaring, Damming</hi> Oaths of <hi>TORIES,</hi> the Formidable <hi>Menaces</hi> from beyond the Water, nor the Damnable Intreagues of <hi>Devil, Pope, Shamplotters, Tories, Maſqueraders,</hi> &amp;c. ſhall never blind the <hi>Eyes of England,</hi> cut Proteſtants Throats, ſeize their Eſtates, Ruine their Religion, Deſtroy their King, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> nor ſhall they in due time eſcape the Vengeance of the all ſeeing <hi>GOD,</hi> whoſe dreadful Scourage never fails to laſh ſo Reprobate, ſo Malignant, ſo Diabolical a Generation as the Sham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plotters and their Abettors.</p>
            <p>To Conclude, a <hi>Shamplotter</hi> is an Indigent <hi>Raſcal,</hi> that would ſell his Soul to the Devil for a Mornings <hi>Draught,</hi> or to a Whore for a <hi>Diſeaſe:</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted out of a <hi>Plebcan</hi> Dunghil; Educated in a Popiſh <hi>Seminary,</hi> (where he learnt the whole <hi>Maſs</hi> of his Debauchery) or elſe one that by <hi>Romiſh</hi> Artifice was Decoyd by thoſe Imps of Hell to do the Devils drudgery.
